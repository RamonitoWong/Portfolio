# Autonomous LIMO Robot Navigation and Arena Creation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Goal**  
Program the LIMO robot to navigate autonomously through a custom arena inspired by Jewelâ€™s Rain Vortex, using:  
- **ROS1** (for robot control)  
- **DarkNet ROS** (YOLO object detection)  
- **Python** (custom navigation scripts)
